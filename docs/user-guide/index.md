# OnMyShelf User Guide

**Note**: This documentation is not complete yet. More to come!

## Concepts
### Collections
A `collection` is a collection of objects. Objects are called `items`.

To describe an `item`, you have to define its `properties` (see below).

### Properties
A `property` describes something about your objects.

e.g. In a collection of books, a property named `pages` could describe how much pages has a book.

### Items
An `item` is an object of a collection.

## Reset user password
If you forget your password, you have to make a change password request.
When you send it, a token is stored into the database.

For now, only the administrator(s) of your OnMyShelf instance can give you this token.

In further versions of OnMyShelf, a link will be sent to you by email, but since now, you have to do it this way.
