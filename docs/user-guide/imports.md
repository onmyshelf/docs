# Imports

It's really annoying to fill a collection with items and properties one by one.

That's why OnMyShelf allows you to import items from:

- [an existing collection](#import-an-existing-collection)
- [items from external resources](#import-items-from-external-resources)

## Import an existing collection
If you uses other collection manager software like GCstar, Tellico, or even a CSV file, you can import your whole collection in OnMyShelf in one step.

### Import from GCstar
[GCstar](http://www.gcstar.org) is a cool open source collection manager software.

Do the following steps to import your GCstar collection into OnMyShelf:

1. Put your collection file (e.g. named `my_collection.gcs`) into a zip file. If your collection contains images (covers, pictures, etc.), be sure to put also the pictures folder inside the zip file. Be careful that this directory is often hidden (e.g. named `.my_collection_pictures/`).
2. Create a new collection (if not already done)
3. In the manage page, click on "Import collection" button
4. Choose the import module "GCstar collection" and upload your zip file into the media library
5. Click on "Import" button
6. Once imported, you can manage the properties and adjust them to look like you want

### Import from Tellico
[Tellico](https://tellico-project.org/) is a cool open source collection manager software.

Do the following steps to import your Tellico collection into OnMyShelf:

1. Create a new collection (if not already done)
2. In the manage page, click on "Import collection" button
3. Choose the import module "Tellico collection" and upload your tc file (e.g. named `my_collection.tc`) into the media library
5. Click on "Import" button
6. Once imported, you can manage the properties and adjust them to look like you want

### Import from a CSV file
A CSV file can be easely generated from a spreadsheet (like Excel or LibreOffice Calc).

Do the following steps to import a CSV file into OnMyShelf:

1. Create a new collection (if not already done)
2. In the manage page, click on "Import collection" button
3. Choose the import module "CSV file" and upload your csv file into the media library
5. Click on "Import" button
6. Once imported, you can manage the properties and adjust them to look like you want

## Import items from external resources
You can import items information from external resources.
For example, you could import movies from [IMDb.com](https://imdb.com), things from Amazon, etc.

1. Click on "Import item" button.
2. Choose the source and make a search
3. Import the item(s) you want
