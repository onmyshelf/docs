# Main concepts

## Collections
A `collection` is a collection of objects. Objects are called `items`.

To describe an `item`, you have to define its `properties` (see below).

## Properties
A `property` describes something about your objects.

e.g. In a collection of books, a property named `pages` could describe how much pages has a book.

## Items
An `item` is an object of a collection.
