# User profile and passwords

## Reset user password
If you forget your password, you have to make a change password request.
When you send it, a token is stored into the database.

For now, only the administrator(s) of your OnMyShelf instance can give you this token.

In further versions of OnMyShelf, a link will be sent to you by email, but since now, you have to do it this way.
